# Shop-Track

The goal of this project is to create a website which will sort the items in the grocery store based on customer's pre-made grocery list.
This will help the customers to save time and shop quickly. I am working on the JavaScript file which will sort these grocery item from 
shortest to longest distance. 

This method can be used by delivery companies like Instcart in which the employees have to go into difffrent stores to pick up items of 
customers. It might help them to shop as quickly as possible and get the groceries delivered to the customers and gain more tips.
